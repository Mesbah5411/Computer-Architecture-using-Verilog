# Verilog-Based Computer Architecture Projects

This repository contains Verilog HDL implementations of essential components used in computer architecture and design. Developed as part of my coursework/project in Computer Architecture, it includes:

- Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
- Register File
- Control Unit
- Data Path and Control Path modules
- Testbenches for simulation and validation

These modules were tested using ModelSim/iverilog and synthesized on FPGA-compatible tools for verification. This project strengthened my understanding of digital design, hardware description languages, and processor-level architecture.

## Tools Used
- Verilog HDL
- ModelSim / Icarus Verilog
- GTKWave for waveform analysis
